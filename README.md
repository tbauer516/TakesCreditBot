# TakesCreditBot
TakesCreditBot takes credit for the "good bot" statements made by others in reference to a bot that actually provides some use.

Takes comments of the following form, and adds a sassy remark taking credit:
> Bot: I did something cool
>> User: "Good bot"
>>> TakesCreditBot: "Why thank you, kind person"

Also uses the voting system to determine if the bot should continue to operate. Excess downvotes will mean the bot stops posting.
